Add variants of `:edit` and friends that can take a globbing pattern to open
multiple files:

    :Edit plugin/*.vim doc/*.doc
    :Split ??_*.c

See `:help wildcards` for a overview of the globbing patterns interpreted by
Vim.

Compare this to the default behaviour of `:edit *.vim`, which will either:

- open a file named `*.vim` if there are no matches;
- open the file if there is exactly one match;
- error out with `E77: Too many file names` if there are more than one matches.

[Based on my answer here](http://vi.stackexchange.com/q/2108/51), which also
lists some other solutions.

By default it'll map `:Edit`, `:Tabedit`, `:Split`, and `:Vsplit`. You can use
`:cabbr tabe Tabe` etc. to use it automatically.

See `:help globedit` for the full documentation.
